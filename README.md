# Generic Python scripts for summarizing datasets


The overall goal of the internship was to produce a set of python scripts that provides
descriptive statistics, wordclouds, different types of data visualizations for any type of
a human communication dataset. The scripts provide an overview of what a dataset
is all about along with preprocessing or cleaning of the data, performing a descriptive
statistical analysis, visualizing the data based on the numerical and categorical values,
generating wordclouds and network graphs out of the data. The above generated statis-
tics and visualizations gives an initial impression of how the dataset looks like and could
also be useful to identify additional information that could be interesting to analyse
further.

**The list of python scripts that were produced during the course of the internship are
stated below:**
- Textual Description
- Data Cleaning
- Descriptive Statistics
- Numerical data visualization
- Categorical Data visualizations and Visualizations combining categorical and numeric data
- Generating Wordclouds
- Rank Difference


The scripts can be executed using **Jupyter Notebook (or any alternative application)** by placing the scripts and datasets in the same directory
